	<p>A protocol is a specific set of rules that networks must follow to communicate. A packet is a piece of a message. A header is a piece of the message that tells the computer where to send it and what part of the message it is. A payload is the actual data being transmitted. A router is a device that transmits messages between network. A routing table is basically a map for the router. Problems in networking can be that it's hard to tell which direction to send the packet, the packets get dropped (lost), the packets get corrupted, and the packets are out of order. The protocols we came up with are that each packet needs a to and from statement, so we know where to send messages are where they came from, the BGP where we asked our neighbors who they were and who were their neighbors, so we know where "everyone" was, and a statement that says what part it is (#1 of 4) so that the networks knew the correct order</p>
