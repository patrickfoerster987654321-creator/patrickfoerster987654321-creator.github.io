		<p>This is the classic recipe my family has on Thanksgiving. Every year, this is the recipe we bring to the table. It is absolutely delicious. I even remeber my grandfather saying, "This is the greatest casserole I've ever tasted." It is a family favorite at Thanksgiving.</p>
		<p>Tips, Tricks, and Substitutions:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Use brown sugar instead of pecans. I know a lot of people like pecans on top, but use brown sugar clumps.</li>
			<li>Mash your sweet potatoes very well. Act like you're making mashed potatoes. The finer, the better.</li>
			<li>It's okay if you overbake slightly. Some people like it crunchy, and others don't</li>
			<li>Personalize it. I'm not your boss, I'm simply here to help.</li>
		</ul>

				<td>Use a table to format the recipe itself. You'll need to list the ingredients and how much of each ingredient to use, and then instructions. In this section, also include the total preparation time and number of servings</td>
