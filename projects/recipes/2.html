		<p>This is the classic recipe my family has on Thanksgiving. Every year, this is the recipe we bring to the table. It is absolutely delicious. I even remeber my grandfather saying, "This is the greatest casserole I've ever tasted." It is a family favorite at Thanksgiving.</p>
		<p>Tips, Tricks, and Substitutions:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Use brown sugar instead of pecans. I know a lot of people like pecans on top, but use brown sugar clumps.</li>
			<li>Mash your sweet potatoes very well. Act like you're making mashed potatoes. The finer, the better.</li>
			<li>It's okay if you overbake slightly. Some people like it crunchy, and others don't</li>
			<li>Personalize it. I'm not your boss, I'm simply here to help.</li>
		</ul>
