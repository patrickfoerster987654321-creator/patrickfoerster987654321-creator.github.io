		<p>I chose this recipe because my mom consistently makes this recipe for myself and my siblings. We all love this recipe. As my mom said"It's the best dip in the world."</p>
		<p>Tips, Tricks, and Subsitutions</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Use rotisserie chicken for more flavor</li>
			<li>Shred chicken finely. Don't just seperate it with your hands and call it a day. Use a stand mixer or chop it up.</li>
			<li>Soften your cream cheese first. Don't put it straight in cold. Make it warm to make the recipe faster and tastier</li>
			<li>Personalize it. You can add other things to make it taste better. I'm not your boss. I'm here to help.</li>
		</ul>

				<td>Use a table to format the recipe itself. You'll need to list the ingredients and how much of each ingredient to use, and then instructions. In this section, also include the total preparation time and number of servings</td>
