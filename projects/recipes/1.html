		<p>I chose this recipe because my mom consistently makes this recipe for myself and my siblings. It reminds me of when I was a kid. We usually eat this when football games are on. We all love this recipe. As my mom said"It's the best dip in the world."</p>
		<p>Tips, Tricks, and Subsitutions</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Use rotisserie chicken for more flavor</li>
			<li>Shred chicken finely. Don't just seperate it with your hands and call it a day. Use a stand mixer or chop it up.</li>
			<li>Soften your cream cheese first. Don't put it straight in cold. Make it warm to make the recipe faster and tastier</li>
			<li>Personalize it. You can add other things to make it taste better. I'm not your boss. I'm here to help.</li>
